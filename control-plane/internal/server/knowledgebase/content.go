		ID: "building/reasoner-python", Topic: "building", Title: "Creating a Reasoner in Python",
		Summary:    "How to create a Python agent with @reasoner decorators that registers with the control plane",
		Difficulty: "beginner", SDK: "python",
		Tags:       []string{"reasoner", "python", "decorator", "quickstart"},
		Content: `# Creating a Reasoner in Python

A reasoner is a function decorated with @reasoner that becomes an HTTP endpoint managed by the control plane.

## Basic Setup

` + "```python" + `
from agentfield import Agent

app = Agent(name="my-agent")

@app.reasoner()
async def analyze(input: dict) -> dict:
    # Your reasoning logic here
    return {"result": "analysis complete"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
` + "```" + `

## Key Points
- Each @reasoner becomes a REST endpoint
- The control plane auto-discovers reasoners on registration
- Input/output are JSON objects
- Use type hints for automatic schema generation
`,

		ID: "building/ai-vs-harness", Topic: "building", Title: ".ai() vs .harness() — Choosing the Right Primitive",
		Summary:    "Decision guide for when to use .ai() (single-shot classification) vs .harness() (multi-turn agent)",
		Difficulty: "intermediate", SDK: "python",
		Tags:       []string{"ai", "harness", "primitives", "decision", "architecture"},
		Content: `# .ai() vs .harness()

## .ai() — Fast Structured Classification
Single-shot, no tools, no state. Input in, flat schema out.
- Flat Pydantic schema: 2-4 attributes max
- Input must fit in one context window (~500-2000 tokens)
- Best for: intake classification, routing gates, binary decisions

## .harness() — The Atomic Unit of Intelligence
Stateful, multi-turn, tool-using agent.
- Has tool access: reads files, calls APIs, invokes sub-agents
- Multi-turn: reads X, decides what to read next
- Can meta-prompt: use LLM reasoning to craft specific prompts

## Decision Tree
- Needs to read/navigate documents? → .harness()
- Process more than ~3,000 tokens? → .harness()
- Multi-turn decisions? → .harness()
- Fast classification (< 500 tokens)? → .ai()
- Simple routing decision (enum output)? → .ai()

When in doubt, use .harness(). Reserve .ai() for gates and classifiers.

		Summary:    "Understanding global, agent, session, and run memory scopes",
		Difficulty: "beginner",

		Content: `# Memory Scopes

AgentField provides four memory scopes:

| Scope | Shared Across | Use Case |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| global | All agents, all sessions | Shared knowledge base |
| agent | One agent, all sessions | Agent-specific config |
| session | One session | Multi-turn conversation state |
| run | Single execution run | Workflow-scoped data |

## Usage (Python SDK)
` + "```python" + `
await agent.memory.set("session", session_id, "user_preference", "dark_mode")
value = await agent.memory.get("session", session_id, "user_preference")
` + "```" + `

## API Endpoints
- POST /api/v1/memory/set — Set a value
- POST /api/v1/memory/get — Get a value
- POST /api/v1/memory/delete — Delete a value
- GET /api/v1/memory/list — List all values in a scope

		Tags:       []string{"tools", "harness", "function-calling"},
		Content: `# Tool Calling

Harnesses can use tools to interact with external systems.

## Defining Tools
` + "```python" + `
@app.tool()
async def search_database(query: str) -> list:
    """Search the database for matching records."""
    results = await db.search(query)
    return results

        input=input,
        tools=[search_database],
    )
    return result
` + "```" + `

## Key Points
- Tools are decorated functions with type hints
- The LLM decides when and how to call tools
- Tools should have clear docstrings (used as tool descriptions)
- Harnesses orchestrate tool usage across multiple turns

## Agent-to-Agent Communication
All communication goes through the control plane:
` + "```python" + `
result = await app.call("other-agent.reasoner_name", input={"query": "analyze this"})
` + "```" + `

## Workflow DAG
The control plane automatically tracks the call graph (DAG) of all agent interactions.
View it at: GET /api/ui/v1/workflows/:workflowId/dag

## Key Principles
1. Never direct agent-to-agent HTTP — always through control plane
2. The control plane handles routing, tracking, and metrics
3. Each agent registers its capabilities on startup
4. Use run_id to group related executions

		ID: "building/budget-caps", Topic: "building", Title: "Budget Caps and Cost Control",
		Summary:    "Setting execution budgets to prevent runaway costs in adaptive agent systems",
		Difficulty: "intermediate",
		Tags:       []string{"budget", "cost", "limits", "adaptive"},
		Content: `# Budget Caps

Every adaptive mechanism needs hard limits:

| Loop | Budget | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Inner (per-agent) | Max N follows, 1 escalation | Max 5 reference follows |
| Middle (cross-agent) | Max N sub-agent spawns | Max 3 deep-dives |
| Outer (pipeline) | Max N iterations | Max 2 coverage passes |

## Implementation
Set budget caps in your agent configuration or at call time:
` + "```python" + `
result = await app.harness(
    prompt="Investigate thoroughly",
    input=data,
    max_turns=10,         # Inner loop cap
    max_sub_agents=3,     # Middle loop cap

		Tags:       []string{"error-handling", "fallback", "ai", "harness", "resilience"},

Every .ai() call should have a fallback when input doesn't fit:

    confident: bool

intake = await app.ai(

    schema=IntakeResult,
)

if not intake.confident:
    intake = await app.call("my-project.intake_harness", input=full_doc)

## Strategies
1. Confidence flag in schema
2. Validation check after .ai()
3. Try/catch with .harness() fallback

The control plane can forward execution lifecycle events to a single, global
outbound webhook. The configuration is a singleton (one webhook per control
plane), so POST upserts it and there is no per-webhook :id.

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/v1/settings/observability-webhook — Get the current webhook config
- POST /api/v1/settings/observability-webhook — Create or update the webhook config

## Request body (POST)
` + "```json" + `
{ "url": "https://example.com/hook", "secret": "optional", "enabled": true, "headers": {} }

## Signing
When a secret is configured, each delivery carries an
"X-AgentField-Signature: sha256=<hex>" header — an HMAC-SHA256 of the raw
request body, keyed by the secret.

## Events
Deliveries fire on execution lifecycle events: created, completed, failed,
cancelled, paused, and resumed.

## Note: this is not the approval webhook
This observability webhook is outbound — the control plane calls your URL. It is
distinct from the inbound, HMAC-signed approval webhook
(POST /api/v1/webhooks/approval-response), which resolves executions that are
paused awaiting approval.
