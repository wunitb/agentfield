/**
 * Cooperative cancellation registry.
 *
 * The control plane's cancel dispatcher (control-plane/internal/services/
 * cancel_dispatcher.go) POSTs to `/_internal/executions/:execution_id/cancel`
 * whenever an execution flips to cancelled — from per-execution cancel,
 * the bottom-up cancel-tree endpoint, or any future source publishing on
 * the bus. This module holds an `AbortController` per in-flight reasoner
 * invocation; the cancel route looks up the controller and calls
 * `.abort()`, which surfaces as `signal.aborted === true` and rejects any
 * pending `fetch()` / Anthropic-SDK / OpenAI-SDK request bound to that
 * signal.
 *
 * Reasoner-author contract:
 *   - `await fetch(url, { signal: ctx.signal })` — aborts mid-flight.
 *   - The official @anthropic-ai/sdk and openai clients accept
 *     `{ signal }` in their request options. Pass `ctx.signal` through.
 *   - For CPU loops or pure-JS work, periodically check
 *     `ctx.signal.aborted` and throw if true.
 *
 * Backwards compatible: reasoners that ignore `signal` finish naturally
 * and their output is discarded by the control plane (existing per-
 * execution cancel behaviour). Workers running without a dispatcher in
 * front of them simply never see the cancel callback.
